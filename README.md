 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

In my Prototype 1, I used the Dropper from Apple Picker's random route drop, and the slingshot from Mission Demolition, plus some UI text display. I use the MDA frameworks, from the first contact to repeated practice and finally reflected on the player's experience. The mechanism is very simple, just use the slingshot to shoot marbles at random blocks that fall from above. Blocks of different colors have different volumes and different scores. The time limit is 1 minute, and players need to score as many points as possible within 1 minute.
